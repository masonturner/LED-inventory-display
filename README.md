LED-inventory-display
=====================
This is a project for Fracture Inc.  <www.fractureme.com>

Code is meant to query a database via a PHP script hosted onsite, which contains information on inventory. A physical cubby system will be used to contain a system for building customers' orders, and LEDs will be used to indicate to a production employee where to place a product within the cubby system, with different colored LEDs cooresponding to the status of an order. One color may indicate to the employee that the order within the cubby illuminated is finished, and should be removed, whereas another color may indicate that the next order should be placed within the illuminated cubby.  

The Arduino platform is being utilized so as to speed up the development process, as prior work has been done on the platform, allowing for reuse of prior written code.
